# LeadScore
<p>To help business select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert 
into paying customers. The requirement is to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the 
customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower 
lead score have a lower conversion chance</p>
